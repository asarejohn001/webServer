## What I learned
### Azure portal: navigate
Navigated through the portal to create various Azure services.

### Resource group
A container to organize all your resources and services. A great way to run audit for cost analyst and budget management. 

### Virtual network
This is how all the services and the resources you will create can communicate with each other. 

### Azure Bastion
A secure way to connect to your virtual machines without exposing its IP address to the public (internet). You must remember to allow HTTP and HTTPS to the web server because they are automatically blocked.

### Virtual machine
You must remember to create the virtual machine in the same region as the VNET. 

### IIS
A server role and features that is needed to turn your virtual machine into a web server

### Public IP address
An IP address that your server can be reached to call for the http request. This is not the same as connecting to the server.
